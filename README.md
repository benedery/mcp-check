# MCP Check

This repository is created to test and demonstrate the functionality of MCP commands.

## How to Check MCP Commands

1. **Start the MCP Server**: Use the following command to start the MCP server:
   ```bash
   npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
   ```
   This will run the GitHub MCP Server on stdio.

2. **Run MCP Commands**: Once the server is running, you can execute various MCP commands to interact with GitHub repositories, such as listing repositories, creating issues, and more.

3. **Stop the MCP Server**: To stop the server, you can simply interrupt the process in your terminal.

Feel free to explore and test different MCP functionalities using this setup.
